# pdputils

Go-implementation of feasibility and cost functions used in INF273. Based on [pdp_utils](https://github.com/RaminHasibi/pdp_utils).

Note that the parser parses the 1-indexed format and turns it into a 0-index format. All other parts expect a 0-indexed format and -1 for 0's for splitting.
